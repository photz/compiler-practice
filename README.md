A messy little Python script that can be used to practice the computation of FIRST and FOLLOW sets.
It generates small random grammars and asks the user to compute FIRST and FOLLOW sets.
This may come in handy when you're about to take a class on compilers and are expected to apply the algorithms quickly and under pressure.
To make the exercises less boring, the generated grammars get progressively more convoluted.
